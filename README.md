Nesatmo will allow you to store Netatmo Weather station metrics in any InfluxDB server.

### How does it works?

It pulls data from the Netatmo API using PHP ;
Change the data format so it can be used with InfluxDB ;
Send the data to InfluxDB server ;

### Requirements

You need an existing Grafana / InfluxDB installation.

### Other info

Based on Alpine so that the image is as light as possible.
Automatic build support.
Once the data is inside InfluxDB, it can be seen with Grafana (for example).

### How to use

1. Create a [developer app](https://dev.netatmo.com/myaccount/createanapp), this should give you a client_id and client_secret.
2. Use Docker environment variables (see example below) for your various credentials.

### Example

With docker-compose, you can use the below docker-compose.yml file :

```
version: '2'
services:
    nesatmo:
        container_name: nesatmo
        image: nesousx/nesatmo-s6-auto
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
          - NETATMO_CLIENT_ID=yourclientid
          - NETATMO_CLIENT_SECRET=yourclientsecret
          - NETATMO_CLIENT_USERNAME=your-netatmo-user
          - NETATMO_CLIENT_PASSWORD=your-netatmo-pass
          - INFLUX_URL_WITH_PORT=https://my.server.com:8086
          - INFLUX_DB=testdb
          - INFLUX_USER=testuser
          - INFLUX_PASS=testpass
```

### Grafana Dashboard

My dashboard can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Nesousx/3941d33ee6c2282c29fa70e69c54fb1f).

Search and replace the following elements :

* "nesoweath" by your station's name ;
* "indoor" by your indoor's sensor's name ;
* "outdoor" by your outdoor's sensor's name.

### Known issues and limitations

For now, I am not pulling data from the "battery" sensor from the outdoor module.
